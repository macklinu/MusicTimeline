Music Player
=============

An interactive music player built in Processing. This was designed to be used to study for listening exams in a class I took during the Fall of 2012, which was called *Detroit: The Birthplace of Techno*.

I will post a video of this working since I don't want to host a bunch of mp3s for people to download.
